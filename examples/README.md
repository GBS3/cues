# Examples

This directory contains very simple examples of all the prompts that are available. If you would like to quickly run any one of them directly from your terminal, then first make sure that you have `cues` installed:

```
pip install cues
```

Then run the following command in your terminal:

```
python -m cues.<prompt>
```

For example, this launches a brief interactive example of the `Survey` object:

```
python -m cues.survey
```
